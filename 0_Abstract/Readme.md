# LED MULTIPLE COLOUR CHANGE

# INTRODUCTION
* *Serial LEDs or Serial lights are widely used in many celebrations. They are used in Marriage functions, office parties, pubs and so on... Our project is based on electrical and electronics combinational circuit technology is used to develop the automatic light system. The system in developed with safety environment when switching ON or OFF the light whenever we want.*

 # OBJECTIVE:

 *The aim of this project is to blink the LED in a more smarter way using Atmega328. The blinking simply means the ON and OFF of the LED, it's simple as that of switching the power supply ON and OFF.*
